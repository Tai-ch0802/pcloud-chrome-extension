    <h1>Privacy Policy for HyperCmdC for pCloud</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: December 2025</p>

    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy
        describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the
        <strong>HyperCmdC for pCloud</strong> Chrome Extension, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining,
        protecting, and disclosing that information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal information necessary to provide our services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Identifiers (Email Address):</strong> If you purchase a Premium License, we verify your
            purchase using your email address against our licensing server.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> We store your pCloud OAuth access token locally on your device to keep
            you logged in. This token is never sent to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>User Content:</strong> The extension processes web content (images, text, PDFs) that you explicitly
            select to upload. This content is transmitted directly from your browser to your pCloud account. We do not
            store, view, or analyze your content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>License Verification:</strong> To confirm your Premium status and enable advanced features.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Functionality:</strong> To authenticate with pCloud APIs and upload your selected files to
            your storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> We may use anonymous error logs (if enabled by Chrome) to improve extension
            stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data security is our priority:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Authentication tokens and preference settings are stored securely in your
            browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync`).</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Transfer:</strong> Files are uploaded directly to pCloud APIs. They do not pass through our
            developers' servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All communication with pCloud and our licensing server occurs over HTTPS
            (TLS/SSL).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We interact with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>pCloud:</strong> As your cloud storage provider. Please refer to <a
                href="https://www.pcloud.com/privacy_policy.html" target="_blank">pCloud's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>PayPal:</strong> Used for processing payments. We do not store your credit card or financial
            information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Revoke the extension's access to your pCloud account at any time via pCloud's security settings.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the extension, which will remove all locally stored data associated with it.</li>
        <li>Contact us to request deletion of your license validation record from our server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
