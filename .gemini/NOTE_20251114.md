# Session Summary: 2025-11-14

This document summarizes the work completed during the session on 2025-11-14 for the pCloud Chrome Extension project.

## Overview

Today's session focused on refining the Material Design Components (MDC) integration, addressing UI inconsistencies, improving theme contrast, and optimizing layout for a more polished user experience.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Material Design Components (MDC) Refinement
- **Comprehensive MDC Integration:** Completed the refactoring of `popup.html` and `options.html` to fully utilize MDC components, including buttons, text fields, and cards.
- **MDC Asset Management:** Ensured correct linking and loading of MDC CSS and JavaScript libraries.
- **JavaScript Initialization:** Updated `popup.js` and `options.js` to properly initialize and manage MDC components and their event listeners.

### 2. Critical Bug Fixes
- **MDC Library Syntax Error:** Identified and resolved a `SyntaxError` in `material-components-web.min.js` by re-downloading a verified, uncorrupted version of the library.
- **Theme Color Inconsistencies:** Fixed issues where text elements on `options.html` (including the folder tree) were not correctly adopting the active theme colors, ensuring consistent theming across the page.

### 3. Theme and Layout Enhancements
- **Improved "GEEK" Theme Contrast:** Reworked the color palette for the "GEEK" theme in `theme.css` to significantly increase contrast and readability, using a high-contrast, low-saturation scheme inspired by code editor themes.
- **Optimized Popup Layout:** Adjusted `popup.css` to ensure the `body` element's width precisely matched the `mdc-card` content area, eliminating unnecessary background space and providing a cleaner, more compact popup appearance.

## Next Steps

The UI is now more robust, visually consistent, and user-friendly, with a refined theming system. The focus will now shift to further feature development or additional UI/UX improvements as required.
