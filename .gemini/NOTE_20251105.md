# Session Summary: 2025-11-05

This document summarizes the work completed during the session on 2025-11-05 for the pCloud Chrome Extension project.

## Overview

The primary goal of this session was to scaffold and implement the core functionality of the extension. This included setting up the project structure, implementing user authentication and file upload features, and creating a robust options page.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Project Scaffolding:**
  - Established a scalable project structure with clear separation for features, core logic, and assets.
  - Created `manifest.json` with necessary permissions and configurations for a Manifest V3 extension.
  - Set up `i18n` with `_locales` for English and Traditional Chinese.
  - Created initial documentation (`GEMINI.md`, feature specs).

- **Core Features Implemented:**
  - **Dual Authentication:** The popup supports both email/password login and a direct auth token input to accommodate 2FA users.
  - **File Upload:** The main view allows users to select a file and upload it to a default folder in their pCloud account, with a progress bar display.

- **Options Page:**
  - A dedicated options page was created, which opens in a new tab.
  - **Folder Tree Selector:** Implemented a dynamic, collapsible folder tree, allowing users to intuitively select their default upload folder by browsing their pCloud directory structure.
  - **Path Reconstruction:** Logic was added to correctly reconstruct and display the full path of the selected folder.
  - **Dev Mode Display:** The UI conditionally displays the selected `folderid` in development mode for easier debugging.

- **UI/UX & Bug Fixes:**
  - The options page layout was improved for better spacing and centering.
  - The main popup now displays the currently configured default upload path.
  - All user-facing text is now correctly localized using a JavaScript-based approach with `data-i18n` attributes.
  - Numerous bugs were fixed during the development process, including `manifest.json` errors, JavaScript module import issues, and incorrect `folderid` usage, leading to a stable and functional baseline version.

- **Version Control:**
  - A comprehensive `.gitignore` file was created.
  - All changes were successfully committed to the repository.
